##
# @VersionInfo:
#
# A description of QEMU's version.
#
# @qemu.major:  The major version of QEMU
#
# @qemu.minor:  The minor version of QEMU
#
# @qemu.micro:  The micro version of QEMU.  By current convention, a micro
#               version of 50 signifies a development branch.  A micro version
#               greater than or equal to 90 signifies a release candidate for
#               the next minor version.  A micro version of less than 50
#               signifies a stable release.
#
# @package:     QEMU will always set this field to an empty string.  Downstream
#               versions of QEMU should set this to a non-empty string.  The
#               exact format depends on the downstream however it highly
#               recommended that a unique name is used.
#
# Since: 0.14.0

# @quit:
#
# This command will cause the QEMU process to exit gracefully.  While every
# attempt is made to send the QMP response before terminating, this is not
# guaranteed.  When using this interface, a premature EOF would not be
# unexpected.

# @qmp_capabilities:
