# @NameInfo:
#
# Guest name information.
#
# @name: #optional The name of the guest
#
# Since 0.14.0
##
{ 'type': 'NameInfo', 'data': {'*name': 'str'} }

##
# @query-name:
#
# Return the name information of a guest.
#
# Returns: @NameInfo of the guest
#

##
# @eject:
#
# Ejects a device from a removable drive.
#
# @device:  The name of the device
#
# @force:   @optional If true, eject regardless of whether the drive is locked.
#           If not specified, the default value is false.
#
# Returns:  Nothing on success
#           If @device is not a valid block device, DeviceNotFound
#           If @device is not removable and @force is false, DeviceNotRemovable
#           If @force is false and @device is locked, DeviceLocked
#
# Notes:    If the @force flag is used, the backing file will be closed
#           regardless of whether the device is removable.  This may result in
#           a badly broken guest.
#
#           Ejecting a device with no media results in success

##
# @block_passwd:
#
# This command sets the password of a block device that has not been open
# with a password and requires one.
#
# The two cases where this can happen are a block device is created through
# QEMU's initial command line or a block device is changed through the legacy
# @change interface.
#
# In the event that the block device is created through the initial command
# line, the VM will start in the stopped state regardless of whether '-S' is
# used.  The intention is for a management tool to query the block devices to
# determine which ones are encrypted, set the passwords with this command, and
# then start the guest with the @cont command.
#
# @device:   the name of the device to set the password on
#
# @password: the password to use for the device
#
# Returns: nothing on success
#          If @device is not a valid block device, DeviceNotFound
#          If @device is not encrypted, DeviceNotEncrypted
#          If @password is not valid for this device, InvalidPassword
#
# Notes:  Not all block formats support encryption and some that do are not
#         able to validate that a password is correct.  Disk corruption may
#         occur if an invalid password is specified.
#
# Since: 0.14.0

# @change-vnc-password:
#
# Change the VNC server password.
#
# @password:  the new password to use with VNC authentication
#
# Since: 1.0
#
# Notes:  An empty password in this command will set the password to the empty
#         string.  Existing clients are unaffected by executing this command.

##
# @change-vnc-listen:
#
# Change the host that the VNC server listens on.

# @target:  the new server specification to listen on
#
# Since: 1.0
#
# Notes:  At this moment in time, the behavior of existing client connections
#         when this command is executed is undefined.  The authentication
#         settings may change after executing this command.

##
# @drive-change:
#
# This is the preferred interface for changing a block device.
#
# @device:   The block device name.
#
# @filename: The new filename for the block device.  This may contain options
#            encoded in a format specified by @format.
#
# @format:   #optional The format to use open the block device
#
# @password: #optional The password to use if the block device is encrypted
#
# Returns:  Nothing on success.
#          If @device is not a valid block device, DeviceNotFound
#          If @format is not a valid block format, InvalidBlockFormat
#          If @filename is encrypted and @password isn't supplied,
#            DeviceEncrypted.  The call should be repeated with @password
#            supplied.
#          If @format is not specified and @filename is a format that cannot
#            be safely probed, MissingParameter.
#          If @filename cannot be opened, OpenFileFailed
#
# Since: 1.0
