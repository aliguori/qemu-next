This directory contains a snapshot of Linux kernel headers.  The included
Makefile was used to import these headers into QEMU.

This process is intended for use by the QEMU maintainers.  It is not intended
to work against arbitrary kernel versions nor is the intention for end-users to
use this to update the included headers.

If a contributor needs a newer kernel header for a feature implemented
by a particular patch, please run the appropriate make sync-* command and
send the results of that command as a separate patch.  Also make sure to update
this file to reflect the kernel version used.

While it is okay for development versions of QEMU to contain headers from
non-release versions of the Linux kernel, any official release of QEMU must use
headers from a released version of the Linux kernel to ensure ABI compatibility.

Kernel versions used:
