Grab
----

This needs to interact with the gui so requires some thinking.  We need
to think about the following things
 - some user defined key combination breaks grab (Host)
 - the same key combination will start grab (Host)
 - we have two modes:
   o absolute is when the guest can understand absolute key coordinates
   o relative means that in order to pass key events, we must grab
     the pointer
 - when in relative mode, left click should also enter grab
 - when in absolute mode, the key combination must be used to enter grab

 All of these features should be controllable by the user.

 We probably need to the do the following:
  - define a 'Host' key sequence, whenever it happens, emit a signal
  - whenever we change between absolute and relative mode, emit a signal
  - make sure we can grab mouse events
  - allow grab to be entered externally; grab should probably be an Action

From a GUI perspective, we need:
  - to keep track of whatever the 'Host' key is so we can display it
  - present a dialog to the user to change the Host key
  - show the status of grab in the status icons
  - show the mouse mode in the status icons

Optionally, we should:
  - Provide a mode where if we're in relative mode and CGA is active,
    we do not do grab
  - Instead, we get geometry information from CGA and implement
    dos style copy/paste

 qemugtkdrawingarea needs to have an interface to set a Host key
  - qemu_display_set_host_key(obj, [key1, key2, key3])
  - qemu_display_get_host_key(obj)
  - qemu_display_set_input_grab(obj, do_grab)
  - qemu_display_get_input_grab(obj)

  - qemu_display_get_pointer_mode(obj)

  - g_signal_connect(obj, "host-key-event", routine, opaque)
  - g_signal_connect(obj, "pointer-mode-event", routine, opaque)
  - g_signal_connect(obj, "grab-event", routine, opaque)



 - emits a signal when host key is pressed
